# Landing Page
## Overview
### As a part of the internship at TDS AVENUE CodeForge, 
I created a responsive and visually appealing landing page that effectively communicates the brand's message while ensuring a seamless user experience. For this task, I designed and developed a responsive landing page "SkillVibe," an educational platform focused on empowering continuous learning.

# Features
* Clear and concise messaging: The page effectively conveys its purpose as a one-stop solution for educational aspirations.
* Strong call to action: The "Search Now" button encourages visitors to explore the available courses.
* Categories: The presence of categories suggests a well-organized platform with a diverse range of offerings.
